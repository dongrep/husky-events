# Husky Events Admin Dashboard

This is the admin-side of the application for Husky Events, a web application for managing and discovering events at a university. It is built using ReactJS and makes use of various concepts and libraries.

## Concepts and Libraries Used

- ReactJS: The application is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a declarative approach to building UIs.

- ## Routing:
    React Router is used for handling client-side routing. It enables navigation between different pages of the application without a full page reload.

- ## Link: 
    The Link component from React Router is used for creating links between different routes in the application. It provides a declarative way to navigate between pages.

- ## Hooks:
     React Hooks are used for managing state and side effects in functional components. They allow for the use of state and other React features without writing a class.

- ## Functions and Arrow Functions:
     JavaScript functions and arrow functions are used extensively throughout the application for defining reusable logic and event handlers.

- ## Icons:
     Icons from the react/icons library are imported and used in the application for enhancing the user interface and providing visual cues.

- ## Axios:
     Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. It is used in the application for communicating with the server-side API.

- ## useAuthContext: 
     The useAuthContext hook is used for managing user authentication and authorization in the application. It provides access to the authentication state and methods for logging in and out.

- ## CORS:
     Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. It is used in the application to enable communication between the client-side and server-side components.
